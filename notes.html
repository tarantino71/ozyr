      <p>Ok, I know its is not the best restult but I put all my efforts to have this output. I had a lot of difficulties but with pacience I solved all of them. I still have to improve and learn a world of things. I thought I was able to finish the "projetc in one week but it was a big mistake. There was a lot of bugs to recover and sometimes I spent a lot of time to do it.
        I never used any kind of library and never copied a code of other website"</p>
